          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            As I want to work as a UX/UI designer in the future, I need to
            present my design skills to the world to build a professional
            network. In order to have a better understanding to improve my
            knowledge of what the developer needs from the UX designer as well
            as what the developer needs from the design systems, e.g. text
            label, padding, background colour, colour on button hover etc. ….
            Also, I took the Frontend Development for Designer course to gain
            knowledge of HTML, CSS, and javascript and through the process of
            1building a Portfolio Website from Scratch,
          </p>
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>I join the “Frontend Development for Designer” course to learn skills in coding. Building my Portfolio website to show my case study and learning some new coding knowledge… but this is not the end stage; the development will continue.
        </p>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>See Takeaway below for more details.
        </p>
        <li>Learning code language by reading is hard learning</li>
        <li>Learning the structure of Coding from zero to publish a website</li>
        <li>Dealing with the code when the outcome was unexpected</li>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Research</h1>
    <h2>Research goal:</h2>
    <li>Acknowledge UX/UI designer role requirements in the job market
    </li>
    <li>Reference of the UX/UI portfolio website, e.g. structure and contents    
    </li>
    <li>Responsive design in portfolio website
    </li>
    <p>By searching for UX Designer job requirements on several platforms ( Linkedin, Indeed…), I found it is popular and expected for UX Designers to have a portfolio website. There is an option shared with a Github link, but it also advanced to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </p>
      
    <p>Before building my portfolio page, I found some UX Designer’s portfolios as a reference.

    <h1>Designing the Responsive Website
    </h1>
    <p>I started to build my website using Visual Studio Code and created it with some HTML elements. At first, I was excited about using HTML and CSS to do the wireframes, so I built the structure with low-fidelity wireframes without finishing my content. Soon later, I found the advantage of finishing the content first because this is important for doing testing. Then, I added Javascript for running the responsive hamburger menu design on a mobile screen.

    <h3>Code quality & Accessibility
    </h3>
    <h4>w3c validator check
    </h4>
    <p>The W3C validator checked the HTML file. I addressed all errors and warnings identified.
    </p>
    <h4>Linter extensions
    </h4>
    <p>Various extensions were installed to check HTML, CSS, and Javascript code errors.</p>
    <h4>Accessibility
    </h4>
    <p>Checking the colour scheme by accessible colors to pass the AA level by the WCAG 2.0 guidelines for contrast accessibility.</p>

    <h3>Testing & Iterations
    </h3>
    <p>With a working website through GitHub, I tested my portfolio with five users. 
        Based on Jakob Nielsen’s scale, the order of changes from the test results is here. </p>
      <div class="NielsenScale">
        <li>0-I don't agree that this is a usability problem at al</li>
        <li>1-Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on a project
        </li>
        <li>2-Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority</li>
        <li>3-Major usability problem: important to fix and should be given high priority</li>
        <li>4-Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix before a product can be released </li>

                Workflow in coding
            </h3>
            <p>This is a<stonge> massive step toward learning to code a website</stonge>, which I have never thought of before. I learned basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding in the front-end development course. Despite how to use the coding language, this is much more important to learn from my mentor, Carlo van Der Plujm, in Career Foundry. I learned a solving problem skills when dealing with unexpected outcomes.
                Learning from his experience is the most valued and precious part of this website-building process. He teaches me to solve every problem on the page step-by-step, Starting to code structure, checking the insects from the browser, and dealing with the situation individually. This is more important than just learning the coding language itself.
                Thanks, Carlo.
